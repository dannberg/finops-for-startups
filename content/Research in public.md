title: Research in public
draft: false

This website (and associated [Github repo](https://github.com/dannberg/finops-for-startups)) is part of a new movement online. It goes by several names (ie "learning in public," "thinking in public," "doing in public," "building in public") but it's all pretty much the same thing.

It's about publishing _while_ you're working, making both the **process** and the **content** available for public consumption. This practice has several benefits:

- accountability
- enhanced critical thinking
- knowledge sharing
- transparency
- your audience gains a sense of ownership

While I am working on _FinOps for Startups_, I'm going to simultaneously **research in public**. This means I'll be publishing notes, interviews, excerpts, and drafts on [this website](https://finopsforstartups.com).
