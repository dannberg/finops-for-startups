 This Github repo and associated website is part of _another_ growing movement online. That movement goes by several names ("learning in public," "thinking in public," "doing in public," "building in public") but it's all pretty much the same thing.

It's about publishing _while_ you're working, making both the process and the content available for public consumption. This practice has several benefits:

- accountability
- enhanced critical thinking
- knowledge sharing
- transparency
- your audience gains a sense of ownership

While I am working on _FinOps for Startups_, I'm going to simultaneously **research in public**, by which I mean publish my notes on [finopsforstartups.com](https://finopsforstartups.com/).
