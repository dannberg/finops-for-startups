Here is a collection of methods and tools that I'm using to both [[Book research in public|research in public]] and write this book.

## Book research
- Obsidian
- Quartz
- Netlify
- Zoom
- Slack
- *How to Take Smart Notes*
- [[Interviews]]

I'm using Obsidian, a markdown text editor that I love, to take research notes and build this website. I've created [note templates](https://github.com/dannberg/finops-for-startups/tree/v4/templates) for different page types and chapters to speed up the process. I'm using [Quartz](https://quartz.jzhao.xyz) to turn these markdown notes into a static site and hosting everything on [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com), all for free.

For research and networking, I'm active in the [FinOps Foundation](https://finops.org) Slack community (free for FinOps practitioners). Most [[Interviews]] are conducted remote using a free [Zoom](https://zoom.us) account.

Much of my research and note-taking methodology is a modified version of *Zettelkasten*, as described in the book *[How to Take Smart Notes](https://amzn.to/49V7cVD)* by Sönke Ahrens.

## Writing
- Obsidian
- Longform Plugin
- Forest iOS app
- [[Book research in public]]
- Anne Lamott's "Shitty First Drafts"

I'm currently focused primarily on research, but I'll be writing initial drafts of sections of the book. These first drafts are fast and dirty, as described in Anne Lamott's essay ["Shitty First Drafts."](https://wrd.as.uky.edu/sites/default/files/1-Shitty%20First%20Drafts.pdf) I constantly need to remind myself that the *real writing happens in the edit*, so get that shitty first draft out as quick as possible.

When I really want to focus and get something done, I'll work in [Pomodoros](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique) using the iOS app [Forest](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/forest-focus-for-productivity/id866450515).

Writing is also happening in Obsidian. I experimenting with the [Longform](https://github.com/kevboh/longform) Obsidian plugin, but I'm not sure how much I love it yet. In the past, I've written in [Scrivener](https://www.literatureandlatte.com/scrivener/overview), but I just like Obsidian so much more so Obsidian it is.
