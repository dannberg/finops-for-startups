**TODOs**
- [x] Import existing interviews from personal Obsidian vault to this one
- [ ] Process [[Interviews|interview]] notes

**Notes to self**
- There should definitely be a section on the Money Feedback loop, and how FinOps is about shortening this loop. Adding to Chapter 1 index
- How can forecast models provide forecasting assistance - FinOps forecast models - We use several forecast models - ARIMA and Facebook Prophet
- Often, FinOps person or department acts as a "shield" for cost-related anomalies and alerts, protecting engineers and other departments. What does this look like at a smaller team?
