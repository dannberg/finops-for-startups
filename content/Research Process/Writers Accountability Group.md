Writers Accountability Groups are an important part of my [[Methods and tools|methods and tools]] that help assure steady writing progress by providing external structure and community.

Writers Accountability Groups (or *any* accountability group) can take many forms, but in my experience I find a specific structure to be most beneficial for my work. The ideal group size is four to five members. Each member should be working on either similar or adjacent work.

## Dann's Writers Accountability Group

**Status:** Seeking additional members

**Commitment:** *one hour per week, date/time dependent on people's schedules*

**Group size:** ideally 4 - 5 members

**Agenda:**
- 0:00 - 0:15 - Status & weekly goal updates from everyone
- 0:15 - 0:45 - (rotating) one person talks in detail, the rest of the group listens, brainstorms, and supports
- 0:45 - 1:00 - Set goals for upcoming week
