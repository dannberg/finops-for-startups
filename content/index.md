title: Welcome to FinOps for Startups
draft: false
---
I'm [Dann Berg](https://dannb.org), and _FinOps for Startups_ is a book I'm writing about cloud cost management and startups...two topics that aren't typically associated together.

Early-stage companies are usually focused on growth at all costs, which is exactly what they _should_ be focused on. But there are many lessons that startups can take from FinOps that can feel like a cheat code for success.

_FinOps for Startups_ shows how small scrappy companies can use FinOps best practices to build stronger businesses and facilitate a company culture of accountability and cloud cost mindfulness.

For more about my FinOps experience, check out the [[Who am I?|about me]] page.
