# Welcome to FinOps for Startups

_[FinOps for Startups](https://finopsforstartups.com)_ is an upcoming book by [Dann Berg](https://dannb.org). This Github repo, and public-facing [website](https://finopsforstartups.com), is my collection of research for this book.

What is FinOps? As defined by the FinOps Foundation:

> FinOps is an operational framework and cultural practice which maximizes the business value of cloud, enables timely data-driven decision making, and creates financial accountability through collaboration between engineering, finance, and business teams.

In more basic terms, FinOps is:

- the bridge between engineering and finance
- a set of best practicies to foster a culture of cloud cost mindfulness
- a collection of methods and practicies to lower cloud bills

FinOps for Startups explores how this can be beneficial to early-stage companies, where growth is typically the highest priority, even over cost.

# Research in public

This Github repo and associated website is part of _another_ growing movement online. That movement goes by several names ("learning in public," "thinking in public," "doing in public," "building in public") but it's all pretty much the same thing.

It's about publishing _while_ you're working, making both the process and the content available for public consultion. This practice has several benefits:

- accountability
- enhanced critical thinking
- knowledge sharing
- transparency
- your audience gains a sense of ownership

While I am working on _FinOps for Startups_, I'm going to simultaniously **research in public**, by which I mean publish my notes on [finopsforstartups.com](https://finopsforstartups.com).

## About this site

This website is written and published using:

- [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md)
- [Quartz](https://quartz.jzhao.xyz)
- [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/)

Obsidian is a markdown notetaking application (which I use extensively, just [look at my blog](https://dannb.org/blog/)) and Quartz is a markdown-to-static-site generator purpose-built for Obsidian. Netflify is a simple and free static website host.

## Quartz

This is my first time using Quartz, so this section of the README is just going to be some internal notes for me.

When running the command `git remote -v` we see that this repo is the origin, but `https://github.com/jackyzha0/quartz.git` is upstream for fetch and push. This shows the repo that this was forked from, and is a way to keep quartz updated.

Fetch the changes from the upstream repository:

```
git fetch upstream
```
